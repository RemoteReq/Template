[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/RemoteReq/Template.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/RemoteReq/Template)

In this Repo you'll find all the neccessary software needed to develop features and tools for RemoteReq. 

This repo comes bundled with tooling for CI/CD and testing. 

What's also neat is that this markdown also comes with a badge to show whether or not the repo builds successfully or not! It will save you the headache for deploying later on.
